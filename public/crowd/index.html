      <h1>Old Programming Wisdom Beats Crowdsourced Advice</h1>
      <p>Programmers as a crowd, like any crowd, are dumb. People find safety in following popular opinions. They see it as something of high value — worth sacrificing trust in their own instincts.
This is why I like to look for advice by turning to individuals who achieved something worth admiring and
show signs of independent thinking.</p>
<p>My default attitude towards something that helps in groupthink, like forums and comment threads, is perceiving it as a waste of time. However, StackOverflow surprised me. I also remember finding some useful discussions on Reddit. But these are exceptions. <strong>Personal</strong> blogs and vlogs, or essay collections like
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">paulgraham.com</a>, are still my favorite mediums.</p>
<p>Being <strong>good at avoiding groupthink</strong>, which includes so called “industry standards,” is on point.
An average set of methods of the top 50% of professionals is a way different thing than what you get by analyzing how the top 10% operates.
When someone starts advising you with, “today, most people,” don&rsquo;t expect a productive discussion.</p>
<p>Below is a couple of quotes of people who did something right and we can learn from.
It&rsquo;s not a kind of content you see often. There are many programs written in contradiction to these ideas.
(Note: it&rsquo;s not a top-list.)</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Somehow the idea of reusability got attached to object-oriented programming in the 1980s, and no amount of evidence to the contrary seems to be able to shake it free. But although some object-oriented software is reusable, what makes it reusable is its bottom-upness, not its object-orientedness. Consider libraries: they&rsquo;re reusable because they&rsquo;re language, whether they&rsquo;re written in an object-oriented style or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Paul Graham, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html"><em>The Hundred-Year Language</em></a>.</p>

<p>— Donald Knuth, <em>Web of Stories</em>.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstraction trades an increase in real complexity for a decrease in perceived complexity. That isn&rsquo;t always a win.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/835164026984243201">John Carmack</a></p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with object-oriented languages is they’ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have referentially transparent code, if you have pure functions — all the data comes in its input arguments and everything goes out and leave no state behind — it’s incredibly reusable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Joe Armstrong, <em>Coders at Work</em>.</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p>The World Wide Web was precisely what we were trying to PREVENT— ever-breaking links, links going outward only, quotes you can&rsquo;t follow to their origins, no version management, no rights management.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— <a href="http://xanadu.com.au/ted/XU/XuPageKeio.html">Ted Nelson</a></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. Time for a walk.</p>
